	to run the project:
					Please run the server side first and then by running the Considered file for the clients, you can connect to the server
					Please follow the instructions in the project document ---------> RMI implementation in python.pdf
		
	Attention:
				 This project is done to simulate RMI and therefore can be run on a single machine. 
				 Obviously, running on different machines, requires special considerations for the network and client-server communication.
				 
	configuration:
	
				If you are running the client and server on the single machine, 
				just make sure the 10000 port of your system is free :]
				else you need to define the client&server IP addresses.
